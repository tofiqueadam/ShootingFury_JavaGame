Review and Preview
This is my Shooting Fury Game project, where two players toss balls at each other, or a single player competes against the computerâ€”the player with the most hits wins! The game introduces essential concepts for game programming, including animation, collision detection, keyboard control, and sound effects. The ball moves across the screen until it either hits something or goes off the edge. If I hit the other player (which triggers an "ouch" sound), I earn a point. The player with the highest score when the game ends is declared the winner.

Conceptually, the game is straightforward: just throw snowballs at each other until I run out. However, there were many topics I needed to discuss to build the project.

The project was developed in several stages. I covered frame design and the controls used to create the form and set initial properties. I demonstrated how to configure the form based on chosen options and addressed code design. I explored various aspects of game programming, including animation, keyboard events, collision detection, and sound effects. Finally, I explained how to give the computer the ability to make the decisions necessary to play the game.
